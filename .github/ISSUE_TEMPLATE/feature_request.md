## What Problem Does This Solve?

Describe the problem you're encountering that this feature would address.

## Proposed Solution

How do you think BridgeMod should handle this?

## Does This Align with CONSTITUTION.md?

Before proposing a feature, please consider:

- [ ] This respects **Developer-First Authority** (developers decide what can be modded)
- [ ] This supports **Platform Transparency** (modders can see what's possible)
- [ ] This maintains **Safety by Design** (mods remain sandboxed and untrusted)
- [ ] This preserves **Failure Containment** (game stays stable if mod fails)

If your feature conflicts with any of these, explain why it's still important.

## Alternatives Considered

Any other approaches you've thought of?

## Additional Context

Examples, use cases, or references to the roadmap?
