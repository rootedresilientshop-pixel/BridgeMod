# BridgeMod

BridgeMod bridges the gap between console and PC modding, giving developers confidence and modders clarity. Developer-first, but modder-aware.

## Why BridgeMod?
- Enables safe, data-driven mods on consoles and PC
- Supports behavior graphs and procedural parameters
- Enforces sandboxed execution and deterministic behavior
- Transparent mod surfaces prevent wasted effort and community confusion

## v1 Mod Capabilities
- Data-only mods (configs, parameters)
- Behavior Definition via graphs (state machines, ECA rules)
- Procedural inputs and seeds

## Getting Started
1. Include the `BridgeMod SDK` in your Unity project
2. Declare your mod surfaces using `ModSurfaceDeclaration`
3. Use the `ModLoader` and `ModValidator` to load and verify mods
4. Provide sample data mods to show modder expectations

## Contribution
- Respect developer authority
- Follow the principles in `CONSTITUTION.md`
- Test all mods through local validation

## Future Vision
- Optional cloud validation services
- Asset and scripting mods (v2/v3)
- Player-facing mod browser and community features
- Crowdfunding to accelerate platform growth
