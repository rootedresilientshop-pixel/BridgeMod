# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

BridgeMod exists to bridge the gap between developers and modders—between console and PC—between confidence and clarity.

We're committed to providing a welcoming, respectful community where people can collaborate on that shared goal.

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces: GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other community interactions.

## Expected Behavior

- **Be respectful.** People come from different backgrounds, with different expertise. That's strength, not conflict.
- **Assume good intent.** When something is unclear, ask for clarification rather than assuming the worst.
- **Focus on the work, not the person.** Critique ideas, not individuals.
- **Help others learn.** We're all exploring this space together. Share knowledge generously.
- **Honor the principles.** Reference [CONSTITUTION.md](CONSTITUTION.md) when design decisions matter.

## Unacceptable Behavior

We don't tolerate:
- Harassment, abuse, or discrimination based on identity
- Deliberate intimidation or threats
- Sustained disruption of discussions
- Sharing others' private information without consent
- Behavior that violates laws or platforms' terms

## If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Document it.** Keep a record of what happened.
2. **Report privately.** Email the maintainers rather than calling it out publicly first (unless immediate safety is at risk).
3. **We'll listen.** We take reports seriously and will respond promptly.
4. **Fair resolution.** We aim for understanding and resolution, not punishment.

## Scope

This conduct applies to:
- GitHub repositories and discussions
- Issues and pull requests
- Wikis, wikis, and documentation
- Any official BridgeMod communication channels

If you're representing BridgeMod (e.g., at conferences, in articles), this conduct applies there too.

## Enforcement

We'll handle violations thoughtfully:

1. **Minor issues** - A private conversation, usually resolves things
2. **Serious issues** - Temporary or permanent removal from community spaces
3. **Legal violations** - Reporting to appropriate authorities if needed

We aim for redemption, not permanent banishment—but we won't tolerate repeated harm.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).

**Remember:** We're here to build something that makes developers and modders respect each other more. Let's make this space reflect that.
